# @dryui/feedback-server

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`d76f9f4`](https://github.com/rob-balfre/dryui/commit/d76f9f4e530c8413431b781f7c1c73720106027b) Thanks [@rob-balfre](https://github.com/rob-balfre)! - Calendar consolidation, input/embed fixes, and feedback dashboard merge.

  **@dryui/ui**
  - Consolidated `Calendar`, `DatePicker`, `DateRangePicker`, and `RangeCalendar` onto a single shared internal `CalendarGridButton` via a `CalendarGridAdapter` prop. ~600 lines of duplicated template + styles removed; behavior, narrow weekday headers (S M T W T F S), and brand-fill selection are now consistent across all four.
  - Fixed empty weekday header row caused by duplicate keys in the `{#each}` (narrow labels have repeated letters).
  - Selected dates fill with the brand color on first click via cell-level CSS variable cascade.
  - `NumberInput`: removed dead `container-type: inline-size` that was collapsing the wrapper to 38px and misaligning the +/- buttons; increment/decrement buttons now scale with the `size` prop (`sm`/`md`/`lg`).
  - `VideoEmbed`: iframe and video now fill the aspect-ratio box via `width="100%" height="100%"` HTML attributes (CSS `inset` alone doesn't override replaced-element intrinsic size).
  - `Image`: exposed `--dry-image-block-size` and `--dry-image-place-self` for consumer overrides.

  **@dryui/cli**
  - `dryui feedback launcher` now opens the unified feedback dashboard at `/ui/` directly (with the docs URL passed via `?dev=`), via the new `buildDashboardUrl()` helper. Removed the separate launcher URL/targets and the `includeLauncher` build option.

  **@dryui/feedback-server**
  - The standalone launcher UI (`launcher.html`, `Launcher.svelte`, `launcher.ts`) is removed. The main dashboard (`App.svelte`) is now the single entry point and reads the docs base URL from a `?dev=` query parameter. Added a copy-prompt button so submissions can be handed off to Claude with one click.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`5049f55`](https://github.com/rob-balfre/dryui/commit/5049f553f31dd68b110e922c192e3d1a10ded154) Thanks [@rob-balfre](https://github.com/rob-balfre)! - - `@dryui/cli`: Adds `dryui launcher` (the default no-arg command inside the repo) for opening the feedback dashboard and `dryui feedback ui` / `dryui feedback-ui-build` for building and serving it. Shared launch helpers deduped into `launch-utils.ts`.
  - `@dryui/feedback-server`: Ships a new Vite-built Svelte dashboard UI and launcher page served directly by the HTTP server, with supporting endpoints and store/client updates.
  - `@dryui/mcp`: Adds an `interactive-card-wrapper` reviewer rule plus minor tweaks to `architecture.ts` and `utils.ts`.
  - `@dryui/ui`: `AccordionButtonTrigger` now sets `--dry-btn-justify="space-between"` and `--dry-btn-radius="0"` so the chevron sits flush-right and the trigger aligns cleanly with its panel.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Strip feedback widget to minimal drawing tool with submission pipeline
  - Strip ~16k lines of annotation/layout code to a focused drawing overlay (pencil, arrow, text, move, eraser)
  - Add SQLite persistence for drawings (survive page refresh)
  - Add "Send feedback" button with full-page screenshot capture via getDisplayMedia API
  - Screenshots saved to disk as WebP, metadata in SQLite, exposed via MCP tools
  - New MCP tools: `feedback_get_submissions` (polling) and `feedback_resolve_submission`
  - New `/feedback` skill for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor
