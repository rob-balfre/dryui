Fix two release-pipeline bugs that shipped broken tarballs to npm, and harden the pipeline so they can't recur.

- `@dryui/feedback-server@0.3.2` through `@0.3.4` published with an empty `dist/`. `scripts/validate.ts` never built feedback-server, and `scripts/publish-packages.ts` trusted validate instead of running its own build. The CLI's `require.resolve('@dryui/feedback-server/server')` failed, surfacing as "Unable to locate a built feedback dashboard." validate now builds feedback-server alongside the other leaf packages.
- `@dryui/theme-wizard@5.0.0` through `@8.0.0` published with `exports` pointing at `./src/*`, which isn't in the tarball (`files: ["dist"]`). Added `publishConfig.exports`/`svelte`/`types` targeting `./dist/*` and wired in the shared `prepack`/`postpack` export-swap scripts.
- `scripts/publish-packages.ts` now runs `bun run build:packages` before `changeset publish`, then walks every publishable `package.json` and verifies that `main`, `types`, `bin`, `exports`, and `files` resolve to real, non-empty paths. `scripts/publish.ts` (manual path) runs the same verification before `npm publish`. Shared helper: `scripts/lib/verify-dist.ts`.
